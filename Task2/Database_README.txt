Troubleshooting: 
- If you're getting an SQL driver error you need to add the sqljdbc4-2.0.jar file in the src/java folder to your IDE's libraries. 
- It's unlikely the 1433 port is blocked (it works on Campus which has a trillion firewalls), if think the port is the issue it is not very hard to open it.
- There can sometimes be a SSH error on some connections. Just wait a minute and try again.
