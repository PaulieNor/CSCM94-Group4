If the project isn't compiling/running for you, check these things:

1) Update to Java Version 18, or whatever is the latest one. Make sure to change your IDE to this version too (it can be easy to miss).

2) If you're getting a "javaFX package not found" error, you need to download javaFX and put it somewhere. 

https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

There's a folder in there called 'lib' that you need to directly reference.

Then to compile this either type this into your terminal in whever all the .java files are kept:
javac --module-path "C:/whatever/the/path/to/'javafx-sdk-18/lib'/is" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml *.java

Or go to run configuration on your IDE, go to add VM settings and put this in:
--module-path "C:/whatever/the/path/to/'javafx-sdk-18/lib'/is" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
And press the Build/Run button.

3) Cry a lot.

4) If you're getting an error about a MySQL package, copypaste the mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar file that should be in main/java file in Sumi's upload
into the javaFX directory you just referenced in step 2.

5) Delete module-info.java and run again.

This got mine working in IntelliJ but it might be different depending on what you use.
